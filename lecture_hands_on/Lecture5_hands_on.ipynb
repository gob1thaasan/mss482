    "\n",
    "ANOVA examines the total variance in a dataset and decomposes it into different sources of variation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Between-group variation:** Variation among the means of the groups being compared.\n",
    "2. **Within-group variation:** Variation within each group or category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [See mathematical details](https://www.pythonfordatascience.org/anova-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fundamental concept behind ANOVA is to compare the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance. If the between-group variance is significantly larger than the within-group variance, it suggests that the means of the groups are not equal and that there is at least one group that differs significantly from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are different types of ANOVA based on the experimental design:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-way ANOVA:** Compares the means of three or more independent groups to determine if there are differences between them based on a single factor or variable.\n",
    "2. **two-way ANOVA:** Analyzes the influence of **two (or more)** different independent variables (factors). This is considered a type of factorial ANOVA.\n",
    "3. **N-way ANOVA: (Multiple Factorial) ANOVA:** Deals with more than two independent variables affecting a dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The procedure involves calculating several key statistics, including the F-statistic, which is used to determine the statistical significance of the differences between group means. The F-statistic is calculated by dividing the between-group variance by the within-group variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the calculated F-value is greater than the critical value obtained from an F-distribution table or if the p-value associated with the F-value is less than a chosen significance level (often 0.05), then it is concluded that there are significant differences among the group means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ASSUMPTIONS: it's essential to ensure that the assumptions of ANOVA, such as independence, normality and homogeneity of variances, are met before interpreting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Post-hoc tests, like Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference), Scheffe's test, or Bonferroni correction, may be conducted after ANOVA to determine which specific group means differ significantly from each other when dealing with multiple groups.\n"

    "In this example a farmer wants to test the effects of different combinations of fertilizer, the density, and the location of planting into block. The farmer decided to bin the planting position of block into categories into {1,2,3,4}. Thus, this study looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fertilizer type (Brand A, Brand B, Brand C)\n",
    "- planting density (1 = low density, 2 = high density)\n",

    "This process is completed until all non-significant interaction terms are removed. In the final model, if a factor is not in an interaction term then one can interprete the main effects of that factor, whereas if a factor is in an interaction term then that factor needs to be interpreted as such. A final crop yield table will be shown next, and the interpretation will follow."
